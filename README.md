# Neural /Piecewise Affine Reach-avoid Computation (NeuralPARC)

NeuralPARC (ICRA'25) is an extension of [PARC](https://github.com/safe-robotics-lab-gt/PARC/) (RSS'24), which computes a set of initial positions and trajectory parameters with which a robot is *guaranteed* to reach a goal through *narrow gaps*. It improves upon the original method in three ways:
1. No assumption on system dynamics (*black-box*);
2. No need for a *nominal plan*;
3. Can arbitrarily decrease modelling error by adding more neurons.

Since NeuralPARC is data-driven, it is agnostic to how the black-box trajectories are generated as long as they are well-behaved and modellable, enabling it to provide safety guarantees on top of extreme maneuvers (e.g. `drifting`) or even learning-based policies (e.g. `boatsim`).

## Setup Requirements
### Installation
To run this code, you will need
1. [MPT3 Toolbox](https://www.mpt3.org/)
2. [simulator](https://github.com/skousik/simulator)

-------
## Navigating This Repo
### Example Systems
1. Declare `init_drifting` or `init_boatsim` within the files in `main` to see NeuralPARC in action.
2. For `drifting`, we provide scripts for rolling out trajectories, validation, and visualization.
3. For `boatsim`, trajectories are collected and validated in [Isaac Sim](https://github.com/luisfelipewb/RL4WasteCapture/). We provide a subset of the collected trajectories in `boatsim_rawdata.mat` so the rest of the pipeline could be run on this repo.

### Custom System
To run NeuralPARC on a custom dynamical system, simply provide `_rawdata.mat` and `init` files with the same structure as the provided examples. Then run the files in `main` to apply NeuralPARC.
